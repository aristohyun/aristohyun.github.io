# Logistic Regression


# ROC Curve    
> 수신자 조작 특성 (Receiver Operating Characteristic)      
> 모델의 성능을 평가하기 위함    

## 민감도, 특이도

logistic regression output is probabilities         
If probability is higher than 0.5 data is labeled 1(abnormal) else 0(normal)         
By default logistic regression threshold is 0.5           
ROC is receiver operationg characteristic. In this curve x axis is false positive rate and y axis is true positive rate            
If the curve in plot is closer to left-top corner, test is more accurate.        
Roc curve score is auc that is computation area under the curve from prediction scores          
We want auc to closer 1            
fpr = False Positive Rate           
tpr = True Positive Rate            
If you want, I made ROC, Random forest and K fold CV in this tutorial.
