#### Intro to Big Data

컴퓨터에 저장 가능한 모든 요소가 데이터

Data most commonly refers to information that is transmitted or stored electronically

`4Vs of Big Data`

Volume : scale of data

Variety : different forms of data. structed/unstructed

Velocity: analysis of streaming data, 속도

Veracity : uncertainty of data , 신뢰성

#### What is Big Data Analytics

Big Data analytics is a process used to extract meaningful insights, such as hidden patterns, unknown correlations, market trends, customer preferences

#### Preparing working environment

MongoDB Installation

# Centralized storage

> Data is stored on the database of one <red>single machine</red>       
> 어느 한곳에 데이터를 모아서 관리하는 것

Whenever you want to read/insert information in it you communicate with that machine directly

## Relational databases

Relation = table = schema

> Allows related data to be stored across multiple tables, and linked by establishing a relationship between the tables           
> 여러 테이블에 데이터를 저장하고, 이 테이블들을 연결해 관계를 정의해줌

columns = attributes
rows = tuples

모든것을 다 구조를 가진채로 저장해야하니까,        
구조가 없는 데이터를 저장하기 어려움                

### DBMS?

> DB Management System            
> <red>Software</red> for creating and managing databases


## Why not Relational Database?

#### Inflexible

유연성 부족       
다른 구조의 데이터를 저장하기 어려움. 테이블 구조 변경이 어려움

#### Velocity

사용자들을 관리할 때는 관계형 테이터베이스를 이용
사용자 DB는 잘안바뀌기 때문

#### No Scalability

확장X

큰 규모의 데이터로 확장X

#### Weak SQL

join등 테이블을 연결하면, 쿼리를 날릴때 속도가 너무 느림

# Decentralized storage

> Database run on <red>multiple machines</red> at the same time

User does not know if he is talking to single machine or multiple machines

centralized 의경우 DB가 죽으면 답이 없지만, 
Decentralized은 다른 db랑 연결되어 있기에 복구가 빠름

## What is NoSQL

> Many argue that the one thing all NoSQL databases have in common is that they’re <red>non-relational</red>

`NoREL` : No Table, tableless, schemaless, relationless

## Features

### Flexible

> either schema-free or have relaxed schemas 

Do not require any sort of definition of the schema of the data

### Scalability

vertical : horizontal
scale-up  : scale-out
server is larger : many servers
buy more hdd, cpu, ram  : buy moer server

Horizontal scaling becomes much cheaper after a certain threshold


### Fault tolerance

A cluster of several machines is inherently more fault-tolerant than a single machine

It improves availability of your system


# NoSQL databases

## Key-Value Store Database

> A type of NoSQL database that uses a simple key/value method to store data

Also known as a key-value store and key-value store database

p28, p29

The key-value part refers to the fact that the database stores data as a collection of key/value pairs
- Simple method of storing data
- Scale well

#### Used for

- User profiles and session info on a website
- Article/Blog comments
- Telecom directories
- IP forwarding tables
- Shopping cart contents on e-commerce sites
- Product categories, details, reviews

## Document Store Database 

> Uses a document-oriented model to store data

Similar to a key-value database in that it uses a key-value approach

The difference is that, the value in a document store database consists of semi-structured[^semi_structured] data

One Data base = One Document

Each document contains semi-structured[^semi_structured] data that can be queried against using various query
- JSON, XML


[^semi_structured]: JSON, XML. 테이블을 가지고 있지는 않지만, 구조를 갖추고는 있음


#### Used for

Web Applications
Content management systems, blogging platforms, eCommerce applications, web analytics, user preferences data

User Generated Content
Chat sessions,  tweets, blog posts, ratings, comments

Catalog Data
User accounts, product catalogs, device registries for Internet of Things, bill of materials systems

Networking/computing
Sensor data from mobile devices, log files, realtime analytics, various other data from Internet of Things

## Column Store Database

> A type of database that stores data using a column oriented model.

Each row can contain a different number of columns to the other rows

Each column is contained to its row
It doesn’t span all rows like in a relational database
Each column contains a name/value pair, along with a timestamp

낭비되는 Null 공간을 줄일 수 있다. 쿼리의 질을 높일 수 있음

The Structure of a Column Store Database
Row Key: Each row has a unique key, which is a unique identifier for that row
Column: Each column contains a name, a value, and timestamp
Name: This is the name of the name/value pair
Value: This is the value of the name/value pair
Timestamp: This provides the date and time that the data was inserted

p41

## Graph Database

> A database that uses a graphical model to represent and store the data

Graph databases are an excellent choice for working with connected data

#### Used for

- Social networks
- Real-time product recommendations
- Network diagrams
- Fraud detection
- Access management
- Graph based search of digital assets
- Master data management
