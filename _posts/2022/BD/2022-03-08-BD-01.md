# Introduction to Big Data

> data most commonly refers to information that is transmitted or stored electronically

`컴퓨터를 통해 전달, 저장할 수 있는 정보를 데이터라고 부르자`

## Types of data

[Structured data vs. Unstructured data](https://lawtomated.com/structured-data-vs-unstructured-data-what-are-they-and-why-care/)

![Structured data vs. unstructured data](https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/structuredVsUnstructuredIgneos.png)

### Structured data

> Can be displayed in rows, columns(table)

row에 tuples, column은 attribute

테이블에 저장할 수 있는 데이터 타입을 Structured data,

관계형 데이터베이스는 모든 데이터를 테이블을 통해 정리 가능함. 따라서 Structured data를 저장하는 데이터 베이스

### Unstructured data

> Cannot be displayed in rows, columns

이미지, 오디오, 비디오 등등의 다양한 타입의 미디어가 있기에

세상에는 Unstructured Data가 더 많음

## What is Big Data?

단순히 크다고 빅데이터는 아님. 어디서부터 어느사이즈가 빅데이터라고할 수 없음. 

페타바이트를 빅데이터라고 할 수 있겠지만, 다른 기업과 비교해서는 이게 빅데이터라고 할 수 있을까?

### The Four V's of Big Data

#### Volume, 용량 

> Scale of Data

It is not surprising that Big Data is large in volume. It is estimated that we create 2.3 trillion gigabytes of data every day. And that will only increase. This increase is of course partly caused by the gigantic mobile telephone network. To give you an idea: six of the seven billion people in the world now have a mobile phone. Text and WhatsApp messages, photos, videos and many apps ensure that the amount of data increases significantly.

As the volume grows so rapidly, so does the need for new database management systems and IT employees. Millions of new IT jobs are expected to be created in the next few years to accommodate the Big Data flow.

#### Variety, 다양성 

> Different Forms Of Data

The high speed and considerable volume are related to the variety of forms of data. After all, smart IT solutions are available today for all sectors, from the medical world to construction and business. Consider, for example, the electronic patient records in healthcare, which contribute to many trillions of gigabytes of data. And that’s not even talking about the videos we watch on Youtube, the posts we share on Facebook and the blog articles we write. When all parts of the world have the internet in the future, the volume and variety will only increase.

#### Velocity, 속도 

> Analysis of Streaming Data

Velocity, or speed, refers to the enormous speed with which data is generated and processed. Until a few years ago, it took a while to process the right data and to surface the right information. Today, data is available in real time. This is not only a consequence of the speed of the internet, but also of the presence of Big Data itself. Because the more data we create, the more methods are needed to monitor all this data, and the more data is monitored. This creates a vicious circle.

#### Veracity, 정확성 

> Uncetainty of Data

How truthful Big Data is remains a difficult point. Data quickly becomes outdated and the information shared via the internet and social media does not necessarily have to be correct. Many managers and directors in the business community do not dare to make decisions based on Big Data.

Data scientists and IT professionals have their hands full organizing and accessing the right data. It is very important that they find a good way to do this. Because if Big Data is organized and used in the right way, it can be of great value in our lives. From predicting business trends to preventing disease and crime.

### Hospital Big Data Example

- Volume
  - Hospital aroind the world generate a massive amount of data in the form of patient recorde and test results
- Variety
  - Hospital can collect medical records in variety form, such as structured and unstructured data
- Velocity
  - medical data is experiencing a 48 percent annual growth rate
- Veracity
  - accuracy and trustworthiness of the data must be very high
  - High accuracy in medical examination, prediction of disease

# What is Big Data Analytics?

> Big Data analytics is a process used to extract meaningful insights          

- hidden patterns
- unknown correlations
- market trends
- customer preferences

It can be used for better decision making, preventing fraudulent activities, reduce cost among other things.

## Example

### Soul Bus

밤에 택시를 잡으려고 하면 안잡히기도 하고 너무 비쌈.

사람들의 전화데이터와 택시 데이터를 모아서 
가장 많이 택시를 부른 곳을 찾아 이 경로를 지나는 버스노선을 새로 만듬.
즉 가장 많은 콜이 잡히는 곳에서 경유하도록 만듬

이렇게 버스노선 두개만 만들었는데도 3개월간 150억 세이브하는 효과를 보임

이때 30억개의 전화기록과, 500만개의 택시 승차 기록 데이터를 이용하였다


### POSCO

POSCO reduced energy input by 2% and save 1 billion won annually

Collecting and analyzing manufacturing environment data through sensors in factory 

Maintaining the optimal working conditions through AI


### Netflix

With 115 million subscribers, Netflix collect a huge amount of data

Ratings, watch history, searchers and others

Recommend the next movie you should watch or smart advertising
