#### Intro to Big Data

> Data most commonly refers to information that is transmitted or stored electronically

`4Vs of Big Data`

- Volume : scale of data, 용량
- Variety : different forms of data. structed/unstructed, 다양성
- Velocity: analysis of streaming data, 속도
- Veracity : uncertainty of data , 정확성 신뢰도

#### What is Big Data Analytics

Big Data analytics is a process used to extract meaningful insights, 

such as hidden patterns, unknown correlations, market trends, customer preferences

-------------------------------------------------------

# Centralized storage

> Data is stored on the database of one <red>single machine</red>       
> 어느 한곳에 데이터를 모아서 관리하는 것

Whenever you want to read/insert information in it you communicate with that machine directly

## Relational databases

Relation = table = schema

> Allows related data to be stored across multiple tables, and linked by establishing a relationship between the tables           
> 여러 테이블에 데이터를 저장하고, 이 테이블들을 연결해 관계를 정의해줌

columns = attributes
rows = tuples

모든것을 다 구조를 가진채로 저장해야하니까,        
구조가 없는 데이터를 저장하기 어려움                

### DBMS?

> DB Management System            
> Software for creating and managing databases

## Why not Relational Database?

- Inflexible
- Slow Velocity
- No Scalability
- Weak SQL

#### Inflexible

유연성 부족       
다른 구조의 데이터를 저장하기 어려움. 테이블 구조 변경이 어려움

#### Velocity

변함이 적은 데이터에 적합함

사용자들을 관리할 때는 관계형 테이터베이스를 이용
사용자 DB는 잘안바뀌기 때문

#### No Scalability

큰 규모의 데이터로 확장이 안됨

#### Weak SQL

join등 테이블을 연결하면, 쿼리를 날릴때 속도가 너무 느림


# Decentralized storage

> Database run on <red>multiple machines</red> at the same time

User does not know if he is talking to single machine or multiple machines

centralized 의경우 DB가 죽으면 답이 없지만, 
Decentralized은 다른 db랑 연결되어 있기에 복구가 빠름

## What is NoSQL

>  they’re <red>non-relational</red>

`NoREL` : No Table, tableless, schemaless, relationless

## Features

- Flexible
- Scalability
- Fault tolerance

### Flexible

> either schema[^shcema]-free or have relaxed schemas 

Do not require any sort of definition of the schema of the data

[^shcema]: 데이터베이스의 구조와 제약조건에 관해 전반적인 명세

### Scalability

> Horizontal scaling becomes much cheaper after a certain threshold


vertical -> scale-up -> server is larger - buy more hdd, cpu, ram
horizontal -> scale-out -> many servers = buy moer server

### Fault tolerance

> A cluster of several machines is inherently more fault-tolerant than a single machine

It improves availability of your system

# NoSQL databases

## Key-Value Store Database

> A type of NoSQL database that uses a simple key/value method to store data

Also known as a key-value store and key-value store database

The key-value part refers to the fact that the database stores data as a collection of key/value pairs
- Simple method of storing data
- Scale well

#### Used for

- User profiles and session info on a website
- Article/Blog comments
- Telecom directories
- IP forwarding tables
- Shopping cart contents on e-commerce sites
- Product categories, details, reviews

## Document Store Database 

> Uses a document-oriented model to store data

Similar to a key-value database in that it uses a key-value approach

The difference is that, the value in a document store database consists of semi-structured[^semi_structured] data

One Data base = One Document

Each document contains semi-structured[^semi_structured] data that can be queried against using various query
- JSON, XML

`MongoDB is Document Store Database`

[^semi_structured]: JSON, XML. 테이블을 가지고 있지는 않지만, 구조를 갖추고는 있음

#### Used for

- Web Applications
  - Content management systems, blogging platforms, eCommerce applications, web analytics, user preferences data
- User Generated Content
  - Chat sessions,  tweets, blog posts, ratings, comments
- Catalog Data
  - User accounts, product catalogs, device registries for Internet of Things, bill of materials systems
- Networking/computing
  - Sensor data from mobile devices, log files, realtime analytics, various other data from Internet of Things

## Column Store Database

> A type of database that stores data using a column oriented model.

Each row can contain a different number of columns to the other rows

Each column is contained to its row                  
It doesn’t span all rows like in a relational database                     
Each column contains a name/value pair, along with a timestamp                    

낭비되는 Null 공간을 줄일 수 있다. 쿼리의 질을 높일 수 있음

The Structure of a Column Store Database

- Row Key: Each row has a unique key, which is a unique identifier for that row
- Column: Each column contains a name, a value, and timestamp
- Name: This is the name of the name/value pair
- Value: This is the value of the name/value pair
- Timestamp: This provides the date and time that the data was inserted

## Graph Database

> A database that uses a graphical model to represent and store the data

Graph databases are an excellent choice for working with connected data

- The graph database model is an alternative to the relational model
  - In a relational database, data is stored in tables using a rigid structure with a predefined schema
- In a graph database, there is no predefined schema as such

#### Used for

- Social networks
- Real-time product recommendations
- Network diagrams
- Fraud detection
- Access management
- Graph based search of digital assets
- Master data management
