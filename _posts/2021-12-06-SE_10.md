# Configuration Management

변경은 항상 있는데, 어떤경우 생길까

- 기기, OS가 달라질때
- 추가 기능이 생길 때
- 사용자 요구사항에 따라 재구성해야할 때

그럼 이걸 무조건 수용해도 될까?

변경은 개인의 일이 아니라 팀의 일

## Benefits of SCM

SCM, Software Configuration Management

- Conclusive and current information
  - knowing at any time what the enterprise is developing/building/testing/delivering
- Assured product consistency
  - being enable to deliver identical items/modify the product without the need of reverse engineering.
- Control of cost
  - CM helps a project to stay within the authorized budget frame through change control
- Visibility in planning
  - any schedule effect of a proposed change is reviewed
- Compliance with requirements
  - CM ensures the intended configuration by technical review/configuration status accounting/configuration audit
- Agreement in interfaces
  - changes to the interface definitions are controlled
- Productivity management
  - improve development productivity and reusability

## 1 : Configuration Identification Steps

1. Define the criteria to select target items for configuration control 
2. Select CI[^CI] and define the relationships between CIs
3. Develop software component hierarchy and define correlation between CIs
4. Define naming rules for identifying specific CI
5. Develop Release/Version control system 
6. Define and Document CI interface 
7. Define the procedure to establish Baselines
8. Assign an identifier to CI


[^CI]: 형상 항목, Configuration item

요청서가 들어오면 CCB에서 판단하고, 승인이되면 CM에서 저장이된다
