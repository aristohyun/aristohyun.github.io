# Configuration Management

변경은 항상 있는데, 어떤경우 생길까

- 기기, OS가 달라질때
- 추가 기능이 생길 때
- 사용자 요구사항에 따라 재구성해야할 때

그럼 이걸 무조건 수용해도 될까?

변경은 개인의 일이 아니라 팀의 일

## Benefits of SCM

SCM, Software Configuration Management

- Conclusive and current information
  - knowing at any time what the enterprise is developing/building/testing/delivering
- Assured product consistency
  - being enable to deliver identical items/modify the product without the need of reverse engineering.
- Control of cost
  - CM helps a project to stay within the authorized budget frame through change control
- Visibility in planning
  - any schedule effect of a proposed change is reviewed
- Compliance with requirements
  - CM ensures the intended configuration by technical review/configuration status accounting/configuration audit
- Agreement in interfaces
  - changes to the interface definitions are controlled
- Productivity management
  - improve development productivity and reusability

## 1 : Configuration Identification Steps

1. Define the criteria to select target items for configuration control 
2. Select CI[^CI] and define the relationships between CIs
3. Develop software component hierarchy and define correlation between CIs
4. Define naming rules for identifying specific CI
5. Develop Release/Version control system 
6. Define and Document CI interface 
7. Define the procedure to establish Baselines
8. Assign an identifier to CI


[^CI]: 형상 항목, Configuration item

### CM Roles and Responsibilities

> All project members are responsible for performing the configuration management process.

- SCM Team
  - Attending Kick-off meeting, SCM System design, SCM Planning
- Project Configuration Manager
  - Manage the project CM tasks
- Technical Lead
  - Handling the changes
- Configuration Control Board
  - Making decision

## 2 : Configuration Control

CR : Change Requests 변경 요청서 (공식 문서), 누가 제시할수있을까. 프로젝트와 관련있는 누구나

요청서가 들어오면 CCB에서 판단하고, 승인이되면 CM에서 저장이된다

### Configuration Manager (CM)

Assigned to specific member in the project team
TL can be a CM in a small project 
Do not recommend duplicate the roles of CM and PM

Tasks to be performed 
- Planning and execution of SCM for the project
- Create and maintain SCM database 
- Define, documentation, and delivery for SCM process
- Establish the baselines
- Change management for the baselines

### Configuration Control Board

? = Customer

### Configuration Database

> All CM information should be maintained in a configuration database

### General Change Management Process

1. Change initiation
2. Change Classification
3. Change evaluation or change analysis
4. Change disposition
5. Change implementation
6. Change Verification
7. Baseline Change Control

## 3 : Configuration Status Accounting

- Records and reports the status of CIs (use CSAR[^CSAR])
- Maintain CIs’ status database
- Identify the established Baselines
- Identify the content of established Baselines
- Status of problem reports
- Status of change requests
- Identify the status of all deliverable documentation

[^CSAR]: Configuration Status Accounting Report. 형상 상태 보고서

### Importance of Configuration Status Accounting 

- Easy to identify problems in project management
- Easily identify actual performance against plan
- Easy to identify problem sources
- Perform corrective actions before the situation worsens
- Easily determine project performance
- Speed up the problem solving due to easy understanding of the CI history

## 4 : Configuration Audit

변경이 발생했을 때, 제대로 처리했는가

Validates that the product developed matched the approved product specification exactly

Done before product baseline CI release and on subsequent updated product releases

Validates that the CI proposed are the ones produced

### FCA & PCA
